# Backend-FastAPI

## What is Xplorer?
Xplorer is a social media travel app where you can share the places you have visited on your trips with other app members, see where your friends have traveled, and keep all your travel experiences stored in your profile. I developed this project in collaboration with Mart√≠, a friend of mine. He was in charge of the frontend, developed with Vue.js, and I developed the backend using with FastAPI, which is what the content of this repository is.

## Features

It features all common operations of a social media CRUD app:
* A register and log in system based on OAuth 2.0.
* A general feed and personal profile.
* Possibility of creating, reading, updating and deleting your experiences, personal user information...
* Integrated maps API, autocomplete features, a rating system...
* Test coverage.

Here are some snippeds of how the app looks like:

## How to use it

* Clone the repository.
* Open the project in the devcontainer (very easy with VSCode).
* Create a PostgreSQL database named `xplorer` (main one) and another named `xplorer_test` (testing one).
* Start your PostgreSQL database and create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project defining your database credentials there (a template called `.env_dummy` has been provided).
* Run `python db_init.py` to autmatically create the tables that the project uses in your PostgreSQL.
* Run `uvicorn app.app:app --port 5500 --reload` in the source directory of the project to strat the backend service.
* To run test, you can run the `pytest` command in the source directory of the project.
